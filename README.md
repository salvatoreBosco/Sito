# Sito

In this repository I wanted to put my personal work to test some skills 
that I have acquired including: HTML, CSS JavaScript, but also SQL using express, the package manager npm...

In this site there is also a part of programming with three.js but at the moment it is not complete.

Also, I posted a video of the site
